## Requests and Tasks

Registering a training involves several processes, which are carried out in the context of Requests.

There are two kinds of Request you can do to register a training: 

1.	*CourseRegistration* for registering Learning Tracks.
2.	*ModuleRegistration* for registering Single Trainings.  

![requests](images/img-01-02.png)

Completing a Request involves carrying out one, or several, Tasks. There are three kinds of Task: 

- *Select training type and Open LT Information Form*
- *Open the Training Information Form*
- *Open the Corrections Form*

The input fields allow you to provide the first level of information about the Learning Track (Title, Description, Learning Outcomes) and the Titles of the Modules that will be contained within the track. 

When you submit your form, you are redirected to the Requests Screen. Here, as well as your CourseRegistration Request, you now see a ModuleRegistration Request for each Module that you named (in the Learning Track Information Form).

Each Request is assigned a unique identifier. Thus, for the Learning Track created by the CourseRegistration request #707, the three modules we named have the identifiers #709, #710, and #711. If the ModuleRegistration requests do not appear right away, we recommend reloading the page. 


![alt](images/img-02-06.png)

You may now open the **Training Information Forms** (Form 2) for the Modules of your Learning Track, by clicking on the appropriate *ModuleRegistration* request.

<!-- 3.0 -->
# Part 3. Guidance notes

The content you provide is intended to be published as such in the DLH catalogue on our website. Therefore, we kindly ask that you follow these guidelines for providing training information. 

<!-- 3.1 -->
## Guidance for providing general training information

### Title

The title of the training

### Short description

A brief summary in one or two sentences, which includes the key terms from the full training description. (Max. 240 characters) 

### Full description

A text of one or two paragraphs which introduces some, or all, of the following points about the training: 

- Context, relevance, and interest 
- Subject and course contents
- Aims & goals 

### Contents

A list of topics in the training. Please provide only a simple list i.e., a one-dimensional list, or the main subjects and topics that make up the contents of the course. 

### Training method

Describes the pedagogical approach and training method. May include descriptions of the course materials, classroom activities, and (where relevant) products and outputs. 

### Learning outcomes

Leaning outcomes are statements of what a learner knows, understands, and is able to do on completion of a learning process, defined in terms of knowledge, skills, and competences. They describe how the learner can demonstrate the acquired knowledge, skill, or competence.

It is recommended to have between four and six learning outcomes per unit (or session) of a single training / module. In general, effective learning outcome descriptions should do the following:


-	Be preceded with a clear statement such as: on successful completion of this course, learners will be able to ...
-	Begin with an action verb and describe something (knowledge, skills or competence) that can be observed or measured.
-	Use one verb for each learning outcome.
-	Focus on what learners are expected to be able to demonstrate upon completion of the module/unit/learning activity.
-	Be written in clear short sentences. 
-	Be written so as to be understood by learners, different trainers or partners, or external bodies.
-	Try to avoid overuse of knowledge- and comprehension-based verbs (seek to include outcomes based on application, analysis and evaluation).
-	Match the scope of the course, so as to be neither too broad nor too specific. Broad would be at the Learning Track level, whereas specific would be for single training courses and modules (of a learning track).


### Prerequisites and recommendations

Prerequisites are knowledge, skills, or competences that are necessary for successfully participating in the training. Prerequisites should be specified where relevant.

Where there are no prerequisites, it is not needed to mention anything. Optionally, you may mention recommendations and provide guidance for learner’s expectations and preparations for the training.

### Level

The level indicates where the content of the training is situated on a scale of proficiency within the field of application of the subject of the training: beginner, intermediate, advanced. 

<!-- 3.2 -->
## Guidance for including ESCO concepts

### About ESCO concepts

[European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO)](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en)

ESCO concepts and descriptions can help leverage the outcomes of training and learning experiences in a number of ways that align with the DLH's mission to narrow the digital skills gap, namely by: 

- helping people to understand what knowledge, skills and competences are obtained as a result of a training
- contributing to facilitating the transition to the digital labour market by making digital tools communicate and work better together 

For this purpose, we ask that you reference your training with terms from two ESCO concept areas : occupations and skills. 

To learn more about ESCO, [visit the ESCO website](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en)

### Search & Select tool 

For each section, ESCO Occupations and ESCO Skills, you can use the Search & Select tool : 

1. Enter your search term(s) / keywords in the first input field

2. See the results loaded as a list in the second input field, where you can select the appropriate ESCO occupation or skill concept. 

You may enter multiple search terms in the first field. The list in the second field will include the results related to all the terms you entered, and you can then select the appropriate ones by clicking on them.

#### ESCO occupations

Which occupation(s) is/are concerned by your training according to the ESCO reference framework? Use our Search & Select tool in the fields below.

To know more about the ESCO occupations concepts, [visit the Occupations page on ESCO website](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/occupation_main).

#### ESCO skills

What are the skills & competences concerned by your training according to the ESCO reference framework? Use the **Search & Select** tool in the fields provided.  

To know more about the ESCO skills concepts, [visit the Skills page on the ESCO website](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/skill_main).

#### Including ESCO skills as prerequisites

What are the **skills & competences** required for your training, described using the ESCO reference framework?
